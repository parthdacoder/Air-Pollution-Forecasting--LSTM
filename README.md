# Weather and Pollution Forecasting with LSTM

Welcome to the Weather and Pollution Forecasting repository! This project is designed to help you understand and implement a standard LSTM model for time-series forecasting. Each component is meticulously explained to ensure that you grasp the purpose and function of every operation. This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning how to work with time-series data through a hands-on example. Additionally, there is room for improvement and further experimentation with the model.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to demystify the process of using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for forecasting. By providing a detailed explanation of each step, this repository serves as a learning tool for those new to time-series analysis and LSTM models. We will walk you through:

- Basic Data Preparation
- LSTM Data Preparation
- Model Definition and Training
- Model Evaluation

## Workflow Overview

### Basic Data Preparation

We start by extracting `pollution1.csv` from `pollution.csv` through a series of pre-processing steps on the raw dataset. This step ensures that our data is clean and ready for further analysis.

### LSTM Data Preparation

In this phase, we create a function `series_to_supervised` to convert our dataset into a suitable format for the LSTM model. We also perform scaling and normalization to enhance the performance of our model.

### Define and Fit Model

Next, we define the LSTM model architecture and train it using the prepared data. This step involves configuring the model and feeding it the time-series data.

### Evaluate Model

Finally, we forecast future values and evaluate the model's accuracy using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.
