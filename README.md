This repository is created for the purpose of understanding a standard LSTM code for forecasting. Each component is explained in depth as to why each operation is performed. This is for anyone who wants to learn how to deal with time-series data from scratch via a practical example. A lot more can be done to improve the model too.
The following is the workflow of the code. For better understanding the following files are added to the repo:
1) Flow of the function made
2) How time series lag functions are created and used?
3) Metadata
4) FAQ's for beginners to help learn time-series implementation
